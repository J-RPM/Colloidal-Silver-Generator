# Colloidal-Silver-Generator
Construction of a Colloidal Silver generator with Arduino
The generator is programmed to produce 200mL of colloidal silver, with concentrations to choose between 10 and 100 ppm. Colloidal silver is composed of high-purity silver nanoparticles, which remain suspended in purified water. Silver nanoparticles measure between 5 and 100nm, and have a positive electrical charge due to the electrolysis process used in their production.
